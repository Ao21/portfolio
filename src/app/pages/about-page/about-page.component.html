<h4>Who even are you</h4>
<p>I‘ve moved back to Ireland after half a decade away out foreign — I’m back now almost two years and I’ve been working as a JS developer at the AA Ireland. I have a dual background in Design and Computer Science so I’m looking for teams that appreciate multi-disciplinary members.</p>
<h4>He doesn't even go here</h4>
<p>I graduated in 2014 with a distinction average Design Computing BA from the University of Sydney. For what I assume is the overwhelming majority of you who read that last sentence and drew a blank; Please, let me explain. My definitely-n0t-a-made-up-course was engineered around combining the theoretical side of design with the practicalities of computer science. Back in those sundrenched glory years we had endless opportunities to create whatever we wanted, as long as they were original, intuitive, user-centered, aestheticly pleasing and deviously clever solutions to wicked problems that no one, as yet, has managed to solve.</p>
<h4>Do you even design, bro</h4>
<p>My skills are focused on design thinking theory rather than the far more important world of making things pretty. I love creating products that put the users at the centre of their design, discovering what they want, and coming up with ways to give them what they need - which is not always the same thing. I always go the extra mile to insist on accomodating all of our users not just the ideal; whether that’s enforcing ARIA standards or rejecting nine pixel beige coloured text on an eggshell background, I always try to empathise with the user.</p>
